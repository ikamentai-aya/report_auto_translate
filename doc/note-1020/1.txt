         Figure 1: Overview of VANT. (A) Distribution View shows the distribution of different metrics related to the quality of parallel corpora
         for training a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model. Users can identify low-quality candidate pairs (i.e., sentence pairs having
         low metric scores) as noise candidates, which negatively affect the model performance. (B) Ranking View depicts the ranking of
         noise candidates determined by a user-steerable weighted sum of metrics. Users can select and save a subset of candidates as a
         ruleset for refinement. (C) Text Compare View allows users to visually inspect noisy parallel corpora in their natural language form.
         (D) Ruleset View depicts detailed information of the selected rulesets (e.g., average metric scores, the number of common items
         between rulesets), so that users can analyze the status and pattern of rulesets.
